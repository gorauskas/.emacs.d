;;; Commentary:

;; This is a simple benchmark of calls to Emacs require and load functions.
;; It can be used to keep track of where time is being spent during Emacs
;; startup in order to optimize startup times.
;; The code was originally based on init-benchmarking.el by Steve Purcell but
;; several modification has gone into it since.

;;; Installation:

;; Place this program in your load path and add the following code to the
;; beginning of your Emacs initialization script.

;; (require 'benchmark-init)
;; (benchmark-init/install)

;;; Usage:

;; After Emacs has finished loading the following two functions can be called
;; in order to display the results.
;;
;;  - benchmark-init/show-require-times
;;  - benchmark-init/show-load-times
;;
;; ctable (https://github.com/kiwanami/emacs-ctable) is used to display the
;; results and must be in your Emacs load path for the functions to work.
