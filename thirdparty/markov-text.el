;;; markov-text.el --- Generate text with Markov chains

;; This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.

;; Author: Christopher Wellons <mosquitopsu@gmail.com>
;; Version: 1.0
;; URL: https://github.com/skeeto/markov-text

;;; Commentary:

;; Generates text based on sample input text. Sometimes it produces funny
;; nonsense.

;; > He wiped himself again, as if he didn't marry her by hand.

;; By default, the Markov chain is generated from the text samples in
;; `data/`. The chain is stored in `markov-text-database' and text is
;; generated with `markov-text-generate' and `markov-text-insert'
;; (interactive with prefix-argument).

;; Paragraph and sentence structure comes from the states of the
;; Markov chain itself so there's no direct control over the size of
;; paragraphs and such.

;; Chains can be saved and loaded with `markov-text-save' and
;; `markov-text-load', and appended with more sample text with
;; `markov-text-feed-file'.
